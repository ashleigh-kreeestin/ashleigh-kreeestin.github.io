Welcome to Will Not Settle – the website and the frame of mind!
Because you have landed yourself here I’m going to make the assumption that your life may not be exactly the way you want it. That you can feel inside you a deeper craving for more. Well I hope you are ready to embrace this feeling!
My name is Ashley Phillips and I have been studying Psychology and people for over a decade. I have multiple degrees in psychology, including my Master’s in counseling. It has been my absolute passion to work with people who crave more and decide to make the decision for change and embrace a brand new life. As much as I have loved being a therapist, I wanted to touch more lives. So here I am as your life coach ready to take on this world and help you get the life you want!
But first we have to make sure this is the right fit for you. My individual sessions tailor to each of my clients unique life experiences and unique desires for a happy whole life. 
So
•	If you find yourself in a job you hate or find lack of fulfullment and meaning
•	If you find that your love life is lacking and you want more dates to find that unique love you’re looking for
•	That you are basically content but just can't help but feel that something is missing and you want more out of your one life. 
•	If you desire more confidence at work, in your relationships, with your family

If you find yourself nodding along you are in the right place.

If you are serious about making changes in your life to bring you more happiness, fulfillment, success, and love then lets get started.
